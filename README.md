# 👋 Hi, I’m Vedanth

Welcome to my learning repository! This repo contains all my practice, notes, and code experiments as I work through **Java** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

I'm currently focused on improving my programming skills and building a strong foundation in problem-solving using Java.
